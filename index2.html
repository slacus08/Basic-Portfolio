		<h2> <strong> About Me </strong> </h2>

		<p>Born in Baltimore, Maryland, I grew up cheering on the Ravens in the fall and the Orioles in the Spring. I attended college at High Point University in North Carolina where I studied Political Science and was very active on campus as a D1 athlete, Equestrian team member, and involved in my sorority, Zeta Tau Alpha.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Since moving to the DC metro area, I worked in politics, non-profits, and consulting. Currently, I resie in Arlington, VA with my college sorority sisters, and my puppy named Pippa. I also have a horse named Larry who lives at a family farm in Baltimore.
